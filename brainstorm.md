Idea 1: Construction Website

Pitch:
On the webiste, the user will be able to build any physical object that involves some sort of construction. They can order items from their build either individually or together. There will also be a jobs page where the users can find people to either build their items or find others that can build it for them. (Potentially using javascript to show a 3d model of the thing you are building).


Audience:
Anybody above the age of 16.


Technologies:
Rails, Javascript(potentially), Computer


Challenges:
Modeling of the construction.
Specific UI for every individual user.


Build Plan:
Use Rails to make the shopping system.
Use Sorcery to build UI and Authentication.
If Javascript is used, it will be for modeling.

Idea 2: Musical Web
Pitch:
The website connects users with other users with similar tastes in music. It also allows the user to create their own playlist that constantly plays in the background. Also, we recommend music based on likes and dislikes of songs in certain albums. Also, the user can find tickets for local concerts that we recommend based of preferences and location. People can upload their own songs and will be suggested as songs to listen to.


Audience:
ANYONE THAT IS NOT DEAD!!!


Technologies:
Rails, Javascript(potentially), Computer


Challenges:
Safety & Terms of Conditions for concerts for specific age groups.
Getting songs and Copyrights.


Build Plan:
For now, make website, UIs, and music playing in the background, buy generic tickets  (If time allows, use APIs to find concerts and buy tickets).
